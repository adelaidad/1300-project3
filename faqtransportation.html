If you are driving, there is a $5 charge to park at the parking garage (You can find more parking information here ). If you plan to eat at the festival, you may also wish to bring at least $10. Prices of the various baked goods, produce, and crafts vary by vendor. Many of our vendors and their items can be found here.</p>
